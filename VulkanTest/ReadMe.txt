This is a test code for learning Vulkan !


1. Based on cube.cpp in Vulkan sample.

2. Uses Glfw to avoid legacy code (WndProc etc).

3. Supports only Win32 platform. (I will remove any codes for other platform positively due to no testing).


How to build

1. It is needed to set enviroment value named "GLFW_PATH" as c:\glfw-3.2.1.bin.WIN64
